// Serialisation is the process of data structure translation of information into the formal that can be stored or transmitted
//  If we have a form on a website and we want to make a JSON call, we choose  a json format, then we need to gather all the information inside the js object, we need to translate it into JSON, and then it can be send to our backend.
//  or if you want to save some object inside a storage, we need to transform js into JSON then into string, and then save it in the local storage.
//  in some languages, like GoLang for ex. the process of Data Serialisation calls Marshalling.

// Data Formatting is hte process of organising the data according to preeset specification.
// Used for changing how the data is displayed.

// for not having any conflicts we are using a local storage here.
