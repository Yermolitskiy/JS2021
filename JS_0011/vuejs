VUE.js:

Progressive framework, non monolithic
additional layer for html
core library is focused on the view layer only
capable of powering Single-page Applications
Declarative rendering
Attribute binding

Instance Properties:

data = properties defined in "data" are exposed to template via the component Instance
methods = properties defined
props (properties) = list/component
computed Properties
watch = used for listening for changes of the data model

Virtual DOM / Shadow DOM

from array -> virtual dom -> browser

Vue and React are using VD (virtual dom)

Livecycle Hooks:

created generated
mounted placed
updated happening in a loop
unmounted final hook when component is taken out from the dome, (to/from garbage collector)
And others
https://v3.vue

Syntax:

Most basic - "mustache" syntax:
<span>{}</span>
used for dynamic values to display
For binding dynamic value to use in logic use attribute binding:
<button v-bind:disabled="isDisabled">Submit</button>     // variable is an actual js variable
Can use simple string together with dynamic value:
<span v-bind:id="'item-'+id">item id: {{id}}</span>
Many move v-directives, like v-if
Also DOM events


###::::

install: npm i -g @vue/cli
Just in case if someone came across the permission problem, during the Mac installation, here's the solution:


1.check the owner:

ls -la /usr/local/lib/node_modules

is it defined, that it's owned by root, eg.:
drwxr-xr-x   3 root    wheel  102 Jun 24 23:24 node_modules

2.check who'is the user (at the moment)
id -un
OR 
whoami
(one or another)

if the current user is you, change owner:

/* sudo chown -R [owner]:[owner] /usr/local/lib/node_modules
 * OR
 * sudo chown -R ownerName: /usr/local/lib/node_modules
 * OR
 */
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/node_modules


if method call it exclusively as a methods
if computed, call  it as a variable
